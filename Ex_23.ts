//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

//let car = 'subaru';

//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

//console.log(car == 'subaru')

//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let myCar = "Toyota";
console.log(myCar == "Toyota");

//single (=) is used for assigning and (==) is used for comparision

//10 statement true and false

//1.
let myFruit = "Apple";
console.log(myFruit == "apple"); //?

//2.
let myArray = [12,30,9];
console.log(myArray.length == 30); //?

//3.
let stdName = "sara";
console.log(stdName == "sara");
