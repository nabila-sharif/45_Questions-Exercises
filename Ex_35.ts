//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!


let animalsNames =["Cow", "Sheep", "Goat", "Camel"];

//printing only names
for(let i of animalsNames){
    console.log(i);
}

for(let j of animalsNames){
    console.log(`${j} is a Domestic Animal`);
}
console.log(`All these animals'${animalsNames[0]},${animalsNames[1]},${animalsNames[2]},${animalsNames[3]} meat is halal in islam`)
